# Notes
# -----------------------
#
# We use the Aspell dictionaries for American English (en_US) to perform spellchecking.
# 
# For words that Aspell does not know, we check at [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary).
# If we cannot find the word in Merriam-Webster but still think that it is in use in our industry, 
# we check for the most common spelling via a google Search.
# 
# Adding exceptions:
# If the spellchecker (Aspell) finds a word that it doesn't know, you can add the word to a 'wordlist':
# - for organization names or author names - add them to `wordlist-orgs-authors.txt`
# - for anything else - add them to `wordlist.txt`
#
# Careful:
# When adding words, make sure that there is no trailing whitespace. Otherwise the spellchecker will not pick it pu.

# not sure how to reduce this list.
# instead of adding all of these words, we could ignore text in '<blockquote>' entirely.
# not sure if that would be better though?
